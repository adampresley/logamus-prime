# Logamus Prime

Logamus Prime is a combination log parser and logger. This project is
still really rough and mostly used by me as a means for logging to persistent
storage asynchronously. Right now it does two things:

* Watch a directory for ColdFusion OUT files. When one is found
  it parses it and places INFO and ERROR log lines into a MySQL database
* Listen on port 9095 for HTTP POSTs to write errors, warnings, and information logs

Right now there is only a command line version of the tool found in the *logamus-prime* folder.
There is also a MySQL setup script in the *sql-scripts* folder.
